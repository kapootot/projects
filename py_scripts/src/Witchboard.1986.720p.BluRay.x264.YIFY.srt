1
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:27,021
I'm always telling you that's the
problem. That is the problem.

2
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,908
Well if you don't believe
in God, Brandon,

3
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,535
then how do you explain
the creation of

4
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,494
the universe?

5
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,996
How do you explain
the creation of God?

6
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,624
- He's always existed.
- So has the universe.

7
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,917
Bullshit.

8
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:52,380
Why? Why is that harder to
accept than your God?

9
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:56,050
There is no way that intelligent life
could have formed so quickly

10
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,136
without some kind of
divine intervention.

11
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,557
Come on, Roger, now you can't honestly
count someone like Jim here as

12
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,766
intelligent life, can you?

13
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:10,189
That's good. I'm impressed, Brandon.
I mean, that's almost witty.

14
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,985
Almost.

15
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,821
I'm gonna get another drink.

16
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,366
Like father, like son, huh?

17
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,794
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

18
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,758
- Michael, I'm waiting.
- Okay.

19
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,469
How does he do this?

20
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,221
Speak of the devil.

21
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,349
Don't. I've had enough religious
discussion for one night.

22
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:46,726
What?

23
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,146
- When did you guys get here?
- Just walked in, man.

24
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,024
What, are you leaving me out there
with Lyndon's, uh, law school chum?

25
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,651
- Sorry.
- Priorities, man.

26
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,072
Jack first, hello second.
Whatcha drinkin'?

27
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,867
Whatever's handy.

28
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,454
Look, Jim, everyone is
kind of fancy out there.

29
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,748
You sure we're not a
little under dressed?

30
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:13,044
No, man, I think they're
a little overdressed.

31
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,045
Alright.

32
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,591
Speaking of which, who's the guy
in the eight hundred dollar suit?

33
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:23,179
- He's Brandon Sinclair.
- Of the Sinclair Vineyards?

34
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:24,972
Mhm.

35
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,976
- Linda used to date him.
- I'm impressed.

36
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,394
So's he.

37
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,979
Jealous?

38
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:38,694
Jim? Hi, Lloyd. Hi, Mike.

39
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,820
Hi.

40
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,158
Well, I guess we'll go
rinse out some things.

41
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,202
Sorry. Excuse me.

42
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,169
Are you alright?

43
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,924
I told you he was an asshole.

44
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,634
I know you did.

45
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,264
You gonna come back
out to the party?

46
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,225
In a minute.

47
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,605
Look, can you just go
play hostess, you know?

48
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,983
Try to come up with
some clean jokes, okay?

49
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,528
Okay.

50
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,076
Jim.

51
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,704
I love you.

52
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,334
I know.

53
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,776
How can you believe in spirits if
you don't believe in God or Satan?

54
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,196
There's been evidence
of their existence.

55
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,365
Eyewitness accounts, photographs,

56
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,117
recordings, you name it.

57
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,078
And I've contacted some of them.

58
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,913
With what, a wee-gee board?

59
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,082
- Ouija.
- What?

60
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,376
It's pronounced, "Ouija,"
not "wee-gee."

61
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:23,215
It comes from the French and German
"Oui" and "Ja." Ouija.

62
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,886
And this is a planchette.

63
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,598
I don't care what you
call it, dude. It's just

64
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,641
like a game. Like checkers, or chess.

65
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,436
For your information,
"dude," the Ouija board

66
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,480
has been around since
recorded history.

67
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:41,233
It was in wide use as
far back as 540 B.C.

68
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,986
I guess if Barbie dolls
had been around

69
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,155
for that long you'd be
talking to them too.

70
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,657
Beats talking to you.

71
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,577
Well, that's because I use words
with more than one syllable.

72
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,454
Oh, would you like to talk about that?

73
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,165
- Yeah.
- Um, look, guys...

74
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,959
Can we play a bit of the
game? That would be fun.

75
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,836
Alright.

76
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,881
Now, for the best results,
the Ouija should

77
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,509
be used by two people,
preferably a man

78
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,469
and a woman. And it
shouldn't be sitting on

79
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,429
a table. It should sit
on our knees so that

80
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,765
there's as much body
contact as possible.

81
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,478
Also, the two people should
have clean, pure systems,

82
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,980
so that the energy flowing
from us to the

83
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,233
planchette is as strong as it can be.

84
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:26,278
Are you saying that the spirits
actually come through our bodies?

85
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,739
Oh, don't worry. It's perfectly safe.

86
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,075
I don't think I quite
understand what you

87
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,410
mean by a clean system, though.

88
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,832
Someone who doesn't
smoke or drink, like you.

89
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,085
Care to give it a try?

90
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,004
No, I don't think so...

91
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:48,426
Come on, come on. Jeez,
just give it a try. Come on!

92
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,012
- Alright.
- Alright, good. Alright!

93
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,809
Good. I don't smoke either, and
I haven't been drinking tonight.

94
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,813
So together, we should be able
to make a clear, strong contact.

95
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,279
I'll bet he wants a
clear, strong contact.

96
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,074
Alright, one more thing
before we begin.

97
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,662
The spirits are lousy spellers
and a lot of them like to lie.

98
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,541
So just to play it safe, I'm gonna
try to contact David.

99
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,377
The spirit of a little boy who
died about thirty years ago.

100
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,339
You mean you've actually
talked to this spirit before?

101
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,341
Yeah, I've contacted
him several times.

102
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,178
For some reason he is connected
to this particular board.

103
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,179
Why's that?

104
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,182
Well, I don't know, really.
It's just that every Ouija

105
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,434
board seems to have
its own dominant spirit.

106
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,645
Maybe it's because this board
was made the day David died.

107
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,023
How do you know when
that board was made?

108
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,066
David told me.

109
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,487
How do you know he
wasn't lying. You said

110
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,989
they liked to lie.
Didn't you say that?

111
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:56,494
Uh, I'd really like to try this.

112
00:08:58,914 --> 00:08:59,914
Alright.

113
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:11,425
David. Are you here?
Can you hear me?

114
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,521
- Can I talk to him?
- Yeah, go ahead.

115
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,234
How old are you, David?

116
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,987
Uh, thank you very
much. Goodbye.

117
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,073
- Why did you stop?
- Oh, that wasn't David.

118
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,784
- Well then who was it?
- I don't know.

119
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,786
Like I said, they like
to lie sometimes.

120
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:43,832
Well, David was ten when
he died, not eight.

121
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,127
Besides, we have a special signal
that no other spirit knows.

122
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,505
Ooh. That's a little spooky.

123
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,299
- It's a little stupid.
- It's a lot stupid.

124
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,851
David, can you hear me?

125
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,897
Would you like to talk to us?

126
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,362
David, is that you?

127
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,790
- It's doing a figure eight.
- That's David's signal.

128
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,585
Would you like to speak to him?

129
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,213
Yeah, I would.

130
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,424
David?

131
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,887
I don't know what to say to him.

132
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,433
David. Do you know me?

133
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,066
David, will you return
to the living one day?

134
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,197
- Reincarnation?
- That's what they all say.

135
00:10:58,992 --> 00:10:59,992
David.

136
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,829
Will you be able to choose your
parents when you return?

137
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,875
Bullshit.

138
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,961
What? You can't believe
you were stupid

139
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,838
enough to pick your parents?

140
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,591
Hey, I don't talk to cardboard.

141
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,262
- Careful, Jim, you're upsetting David.
- What's he gonna do, haunt me?

142
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,680
David, are you all right?

143
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,516
He's alright. He's just
a little dead, that's all.

144
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,686
Shut up, Jim! David,
are you all right?

145
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,189
Brandon, it's really racing.

146
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,903
Yeah, maybe he's late for the
last flight back to limbo.

147
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,128
- What was that noise?
- Sounded like a gunshot.

148
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,714
'Scuse me, folks. Pardon me.

149
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:02,638
Oh, man, multiple sadness.
Who owns the red Cobra?

150
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,267
- I do, why?
- Your tires are history, bud.

151
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:13,982
Thanks a lot, Morar.

152
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,361
- What? This is my fault?
- Those were brand new tires!

153
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,279
Now how do you explain it?

154
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,033
I don't know man, maybe
your buddy Casper did it.

155
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,619
That's right. Because
you made him angry.

156
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,580
Then why didn't he
flatten my tires?

157
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,626
Why? Because I was in control of
the board; he held me responsible.

158
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,504
- You're crazy.
- You're drunk.

159
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:39,675
And you're a loser. In
a great family tradition.

160
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:44,263
Jim! Jim.

161
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,366
Well thank you very much
for ruining the party.

162
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,789
You're welcome.
But don't worry.

163
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,293
The night's still young.

164
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,962
Are you serious?

165
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,174
Look at me. I am furious
with you right now.

166
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,719
I know. And you're so gorgeous
when you're angry.

167
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,681
Look. Don't joke when
you're this close to death.

168
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:32,936
Okay, okay. I'm sorry about the
party and I'm sorry about Brandon.

169
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,483
And I'm sorry about the
crisis in the Middle East.

170
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,110
Alright. That's it.

171
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:47,201
Come on, come on. You knew you were
taking a chance when you invited him.

172
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,832
I know your heart was in the right
place. It just didn't work out.

173
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:59,505
Jim, you promised me that you weren't
gonna start anything with him.

174
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,131
I kept my promise.

175
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,342
He started it.

176
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,514
What did you want me to do?

177
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,724
Just sit there and take it?

178
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:21,360
No, I guess not.

179
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,654
I really am sorry.

180
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,157
I know.

181
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,689
- Why do I love you so much?
- 'Cause I make you laugh.

182
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,149
Yeah? And Woody Allen makes me laugh.

183
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,652
I know, but I'm sexier.

184
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,405
Whatcha doing?

185
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,867
I lost my hammer.

186
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,662
Use mine.

187
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,669
Sucker, you could have killed me.

188
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,883
Nah, then you'd come back and haunt
me and flatten my tires and stuff.

189
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,352
Sit down, sit down.

190
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,982
Linda's putting Twinkies
in my lunch again.

191
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,119
Ms. Brewster, this is
Dr. Gelineau's office

192
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,038
calling. We have the
results of your test

193
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,250
back from the lab. You can
call us today until 12:30.

194
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,466
Hello, Linda. This is
Brandon. I just realized

195
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,426
I left my Ouija here
the other night.

196
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,262
Could you bring it to class
this Friday? I'm having

197
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,807
some friends over Sunday
and they want to use it.

198
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,602
Besides, I want to contact David
to see if he's calmed

199
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,313
down yet. Well, see you Friday. Bye.

200
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,748
David, are you here?

201
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,257
David, is that you?

202
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,304
David, do you remember me?

203
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,814
David, is it true that you can really
choose your next parents?

204
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,526
Do you know why I'm asking?

205
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,451
The tests... They're positive.

206
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,462
David, would you like to-

207
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,589
No? How come?

208
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:17,971
J. I. M.

209
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,683
Jim? What? You don't like Jim?

210
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,437
Well, Jim's a really nice g-

211
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,192
Boy, David, you sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't you?

212
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:36,573
David? David, are you here?
David, where are you?

213
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,496
Man, don't tell me you bought that
crap with Brandon and that board.

214
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:47,375
Oh, please. What do you-Do you see
"Spaz" written on this man anywhere?

215
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,127
Please.

216
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,131
So how'd the board
jump off their knees?

217
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,425
I dunno, man. He probably kicked it.

218
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:00,806
He always was about as clever
as a bag full of doorknobs.

219
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,767
What is it with you guys, anyway?

220
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,897
Linda, I guess. At least that's
when the friendship ended.

221
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,524
You guys were friends?

222
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,609
Best friends.

223
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,486
When we were kids.

224
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,364
Get outta here.

225
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,909
Yeah, I practically grew
up in Brandon's house.

226
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:28,416
Both my folks were
alcoholics, and, uh...

227
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,754
I didn't want to spend too
much time at home.

228
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,636
He thinks I stole Linda from him.

229
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,180
- Did you?
- No.

230
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,142
No.

231
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,562
I didn't even know they
knew each other.

232
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,567
I'd been off at med school, and when I
met her they'd already broken up.

233
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,569
You went to med school?

234
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,865
Didn't know I was such a
multifaceted dude, did you?

235
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,535
I didn't know you had more
than one brain cell, James.

236
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,872
What are you doing here?

237
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,501
Love. Come on, lunch is over.

238
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,253
No! Daddy, please?

239
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,464
Come on, I want to finish
the job this month.

240
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,676
You are bringing me way down, bud.

241
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,804
You're a lazy scumbag, you know that.

242
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,392
Employment means
nothing to me, pal.

243
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,565
Lloyd?

244
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,422
David, are you here?

245
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,304
Well, it's nice to see
you made it back.

246
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,809
R.

247
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,977
I.

248
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,271
N.

249
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,232
G.

250
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,859
Ring?

251
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,862
My diamond ring?

252
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,866
You know where it is?

253
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,454
Where?

254
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,791
D.

255
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,502
R.

256
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,212
A.

257
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,588
N.

258
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,513
You mean "drain?"
Like a sink drain?

259
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,685
Which sink? The kitchen?

260
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,858
The bathroom.

261
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,780
Thanks, David.

262
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:49,909
Oh! Ow. Darn.

263
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:51,995
There goes my nail.

264
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:44,047
Jesus Christ, don't ever sneak
up on me again. Fuck!

265
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,091
Shit.

266
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,176
Fuck.

267
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,140
What are you doing home?

268
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,642
I live here.

269
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,103
What are you up to?

270
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:04,150
I found my ring. Remember the one
that I lost when we moved in? See?

271
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:07,695
And that's such a monumental event
that you started swearing?

272
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,739
What?

273
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,159
Your language, babe. I think
"gosh" and "darn" are

274
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,620
the strongest words I've
ever heard you use.

275
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,207
And when did you take up plumbing?

276
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:25,088
You're never gonna believe
this. David, he told-

277
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,548
Uh, David who?

278
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,343
You remember David. The
spirit of the little boy?

279
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,679
Oh, I don't need to
hear this shit now.

280
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:42,480
Jim! What's-What's the matter?

281
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,406
They closed the site early today.
There was an accident, and...

282
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,287
Lloyd, uh...

283
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,707
Lloyd got killed.

284
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,881
Oh, god, what happened?

285
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,133
There was a load of sheet rock, and it

286
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:17,307
wasn't secured properly,
and it... fell.

287
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:26,858
I've never liked you doing
that job. It is so dangerous.

288
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,112
Everything is dangerous.

289
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,478
Mr. Morar?

290
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,066
My name is Duherst.

291
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,611
Lieutenant Duherst.

292
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,905
- Police?
- Homicide.

293
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,867
I didn't know Fairfield had
a homicide division.

294
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,537
I'm it! I'm also the bomb squad
and the truancy division.

295
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,914
- Do you like magic?
- What?

296
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,502
Magic, you know. Card tricks, sawing
ladies in half. Magic.

297
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,089
Yeah, I guess.

298
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,133
Me too. I always wanted
to be a magician.

299
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,845
I don't have the hands for it, though.
Not, uh, dextrous enough.

300
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:05,183
- Then how do you defuse bombs?
- I don't know.

301
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,810
No one's ever planted a bomb here.

302
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,605
What can I do for you, lieutenant?

303
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,941
I'm investigating Mr.
Salvador's death.

304
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,029
You ever been to Vegas?

305
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,698
No. Why?

306
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,285
They got these two guys
there, Sigmund and Roy.

307
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,080
I mean, they are the best
magicians I have ever

308
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,498
seen, without a doubt.

309
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,001
I mean, they do some
really amazing things.

310
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,714
You know, there's only
one thing I like better

311
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,466
than seeing a good magic trick.

312
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,719
It's trying to figure
out how it was done.

313
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,475
Lieutenant, we're not really talking
about magic, here, are we?

314
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,812
No.

315
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,816
I believe Mr. Salvador was murdered.

316
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,027
The ropes holding the sheet
rock on the scaffolding

317
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,279
were cut, apparently with
some sort of hatchet.

318
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,866
- Are you sure?
- I'm afraid so.

319
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,828
Did he have any enemies?

320
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,957
No. None that I know of.

321
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,128
I understand that you were with him
when the sheet rock fell.

322
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,046
Now, is there any
chance that the killer

323
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,548
could have been aiming for you?

324
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,511
- I don't think so.
- Are there any other witnesses?

325
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,890
No. No, I'm afraid not.

326
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,894
And you lost your hatchet
that same day.

327
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,648
I lost my hammer.

328
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,401
But it has a blade on one side, right?

329
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,947
Have you found it yet?

330
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:48,536
No. No, I had to buy a new one.

331
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,373
Just vanished into thin air, huh?

332
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,334
Nothing up my sleeve.

333
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,464
Touche.

334
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:05,344
I'm sorry for intruding here.

335
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,645
Jim, you didn't tell me
you were with him.

336
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,815
I didn't think it was important.

337
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,234
It is important, it could
have been you!

338
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:26,240
Hey, it was just an accident, that's
all. It was just an accident.

339
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,868
Can we go?

340
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,751
Well, the lieutenant's
not too sure about that.

341
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,420
And neither am I.

342
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,468
David? Did you cause that
accident at the site?

343
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,266
David, don't lie to me.

344
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,527
Are you still angry at Jim?

345
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:06,364
David?

346
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,118
David.

347
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,262
Hello?

348
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,638
Where were you?

349
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,848
What?

350
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,851
You were supposed to bring
my Ouija by class yesterday.

351
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,354
God, I am so sorry,
I completely forgot.

352
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,606
I went to the funeral with Jim.

353
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,402
Oh. Yeah, of course, uh...

354
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,572
Well, how's he taking it?

355
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,283
Well, he's sleeping right now.

356
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,259
Kind of figures.

357
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,078
Brandon, that's not even fair.

358
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,374
Isn't it? Tell me, did he
cry at the funeral?

359
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,797
Face it, Linda.

360
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,049
The man has ice in his
veins. I've known him

361
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,260
since he was seven and I've
never seen him cry once.

362
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,304
Not once. Not for anybody or anything.

363
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:24,525
Brandon? How many times
have you contacted David?

364
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,693
David?

365
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,864
Quite a few times. Why?

366
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,491
Have you ever seen him get that angry?

367
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:37,622
No, never. Look, did we just change
subjects when I wasn't looking?

368
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:44,337
Brandon, I've been getting a little
worried. I've been using the Ouija.

369
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,338
Alone?

370
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,089
Yeah. Why?

371
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,300
Linda, listen to me.

372
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:55,097
Hello? Hello?

373
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,974
Brandon?

374
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:59,101
- Hello?
- Hello.

375
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:04,315
God damn it, how many times have
I told you not to sneak up on me?

376
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,651
Look, I'm sorry, next
time I'll wear a bell.

377
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,320
Why don't you just rattle your
fucking head next time?

378
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,659
What the hell's eating you?

379
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,870
I don't know.

380
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:23,542
I don't know, I'm so scared.
I feel like I'm going crazy.

381
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,882
It's alright.

382
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,592
It's gonna be alright.

383
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,854
I'm pregnant.

384
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,072
Are you sure?

385
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,866
I mean, did you see a doctor?

386
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,288
I already know.

387
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,749
I have an appointment on Monday.

388
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,835
And I've been having morning
sickness all week.

389
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,550
Well, no wonder.

390
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,678
No wonder you're a nervous wreck.

391
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:22,560
You're not going crazy. You're
just becoming a mother.

392
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,357
Granted, it's almost the same thing.

393
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,109
You're not upset?

394
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:37,575
No. No. Of course not.

395
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,245
God, I love you.

396
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,250
I know.

397
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,258
And you love me.

398
00:34:56,053 --> 00:35:01,766
Even though you don't
know it, I know it.

399
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,855
I'm giving the board back
to Brandon today.

400
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,070
I've already made up my mind, David.
There's nothing you can do about it.

401
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,815
Oh my god.

402
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,557
Hey. Hey. Do you know
Jim Morar? Where is he?

403
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,092
What are you doing here?

404
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,552
I tried to call but your
phone was dead.

405
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,223
And you drove all the way
out here to tell me that?

406
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,394
No. I want to ask you
something about Linda.

407
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,272
You want to know if she snores.

408
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,774
I should've known better.

409
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:42,945
Hey. Hey! Jesus, man, you used
to have a sense of humor.

410
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,990
Okay, can you be serious
for one minute, please?

411
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,158
I'll give it a shot.

412
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,828
Has Linda been acting
strange lately?

413
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,747
She hasn't been to a single
one of her classes all week.

414
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,165
What do you mean, "strange?"

415
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:59,753
I mean nervous tension,
insomnia, nausea,

416
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,964
any kind of erratic behavior?

417
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,216
How did you know?

418
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,928
Has she been swearing a lot?

419
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,932
Like a truck driver.

420
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,685
I think Linda's been using my Ouija.

421
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,104
No.

422
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:26,655
Alright. Alright, I know you
think this is a crock of shit.

423
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,158
But just bear with me
for a minute, please.

424
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,118
Okay.

425
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:35,122
Okay. When someone
uses a Ouija alone,

426
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,292
like Linda, she's very
susceptible to the

427
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:42,296
spirits she contacts. And the wrong
spirit will take advantage of this.

428
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,508
At first, he'll be extremely
helpful and friendly.

429
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:50,262
So that she's lured into using
the board more and more.

430
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:53,182
Pretty soon all she wants
to do is use the board.

431
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,977
Everything else, like going to
classes, becomes unimportant.

432
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,106
This is called progressive entrapment.

433
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:06,820
When she reaches this
stage, the spirit changes.

434
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,032
He starts to frighten
and terrorize her.

435
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:13,494
Gradually breaking down
her resistance. And

436
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,955
once that's done, he's
able to possess her.

437
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:28,092
So, what you're telling me is
that I'm living with Linda Blair.

438
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,636
Dammit, Jim, I'm serious!

439
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,307
I know. That's what makes it so funny.

440
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,185
I thought you were an atheist, man.

441
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,979
Look, I'm not saying
that it's a demon.

442
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,981
Just the spirit of someone evil.

443
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,859
Evil when he was alive and
evil now that he's dead

444
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,197
I want to bring a medium
by your apartment

445
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,241
as soon as possible
to exorcise the spirit.

446
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,122
You're serious.

447
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,540
Jim.

448
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,584
How do you think I knew all
those things about Linda?

449
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,963
Those are all symptoms of
progressive entrapment.

450
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,508
They're also all symptoms
of pregnancy.

451
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,718
What?

452
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:13,804
Linda's pregnant.

453
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,722
I'm going to be a father.

454
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,393
Terrific.

455
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:25,357
Come on, Brandon. I mean,
can't you be happy for us?

456
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,360
You gonna marry her?

457
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,114
Yeah.

458
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,158
Of course.

459
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,661
You don't even love her.

460
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,999
Let me tell you something. You
haven't talked to me in two years.

461
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,877
So don't stand there
and tell me how I feel.

462
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,925
I know you better than
you think I do, Jim.

463
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:56,388
I knew why you dropped out
of med school, does Linda?

464
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,183
Because you knew you'd
make a lousy doctor.

465
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,311
Because you're not capable of giving
a shit about anyone but yourself.

466
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:02,978
Shut up, Brandon.

467
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,230
And when you get tired
of Linda you're gonna

468
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,566
walk away from her too,
just like with school.

469
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:08,317
Shut up, Brandon.

470
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,611
Just like you did with your
parents, just like with-

471
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:11,695
Shut up!

472
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,573
- Jim?
- What?

473
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,619
There's a phone call for you
in the foreman's trailer.

474
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,956
- Take a message, I'm busy.
- It's your landlady, man.

475
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,625
It's something about Linda.

476
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,254
She alright?

477
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:48,315
Hello?

478
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,234
Jim, this is Mrs. Boses.

479
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,069
Is Linda alright?

480
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,697
Well, she's fine now but she
was scared awfully bad.

481
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,908
Well, let me talk to
her. Is she there?

482
00:42:58,368 --> 00:42:59,451
Yeah. Just a minute.

483
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:05,415
- Jim?
- I'm right here, babe.

484
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,836
- It was David.
- David?

485
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,089
Yeah.

486
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,592
Jim, he used to be so nice, but-

487
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,639
I don't know, I'm just so scared.

488
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,476
It's alright, babe. I'm
on my way home.

489
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:27,187
And I'll take care of it, I promise.

490
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,606
Alright?

491
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,732
Okay.

492
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,668
Alright, bring your medium by tonight.

493
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,676
Jim, this is Zarabeth. Best
medium in Northern California.

494
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:04,182
Hi. Thanks for coming.

495
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:10,188
No prob, heh. Hey, nice place.

496
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,652
But, uh, you got yourself one gnarly
spirit here, I can feel it.

497
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:20,115
- See the hair standing up on my arm?
- Mhm.

498
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,460
This is your expert? Where'd
you find her, the circus?

499
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:34,504
- OK, she's a bit strange, but...
- A bit strange?

500
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,174
Her head looks like
a friggin' rainbow.

501
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,970
You must be Linda.

502
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:47,517
- Uh, Linda, this is Zarabeth.
- Hi.

503
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,644
She's a medium.

504
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,271
How bitchin'.

505
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:55,734
Uh, yeah, I prepared everything
like he said to.

506
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,699
Top-notch job, Jim. Let's get
this show on the road.

507
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,836
I can't believe you did all
this while I was sleeping.

508
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:20,592
Okay.

509
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:27,516
I'm gonna make contact now, so
whatever happens, stay in your seat.

510
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:31,228
Alright? If you stand or talk,
the contact might be broken.

511
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,859
Oh.
Bummer.

512
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,487
I forgot my crystal ball. Ha!

513
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:52,374
Just a little psychic humor, I don't
really have a crystal ball.

514
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,459
Should we hold hands
or something?

515
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:58,088
Nah, that's just in the
vampire movies.

516
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,799
Anyway, my nails are too grody.

517
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:11,101
Okay, let's talk to some ghosts.

518
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,719
Who are you?

519
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:48,305
Please don't hate me.

520
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:49,890
Who are you?

521
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,101
David.

522
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,939
David, do you know me?

523
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,028
Yes, Brandon, I know you.

524
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:05,906
How old are you?

525
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,699
Ten.

526
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,453
I passed away.

527
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:17,125
Tell us. Why are you
terrorizing Linda?

528
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,127
I love Linda.

529
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:21,588
Then why are you frightening her?

530
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:30,347
She hurt me. She won't
talk to me anymore.

531
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,142
Because of him.

532
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,644
Jim?

533
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:38,563
He is cruel.

534
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:43,193
You are cruel, David.
Linda fears you.

535
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,613
I'm sorry.

536
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,282
I was angry.

537
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,828
I...

538
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,707
I love you.

539
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,336
Linda no longer wishes
to speak to you.

540
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:03,547
I am taking the Ouija
home with me tonight.

541
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,508
I know.

542
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:09,594
The woman you are speaking
through is a psychic.

543
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,347
She has the power to exorcise
you from this apartment.

544
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:17,477
No... I'll go.

545
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:22,274
I never meant to harm anyone.

546
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,069
Goodbye.

547
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,446
- David, why...
- Goodbye.

548
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,449
- David, wait!
- Linda! Don't!

549
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,939
Ahh.

550
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,318
Brandy, catch the lights, huh?

551
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,028
Huh?

552
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,364
Oh, yeah.

553
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,162
Zarabeth, thank you.

554
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:19,039
Too cool.

555
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:23,251
But I didn't do it. David
left on his own.

556
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:26,212
Yeah, well, he sure knows how
to make a dramatic exit.

557
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,049
Well, maybe I reacted
a little too quick.

558
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,759
What?

559
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,427
I don't know, maybe I should
have given him more

560
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,638
of a chance, you know?
He's not evil, he's just...

561
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,431
He's just like a little boy.

562
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:37,641
No way.

563
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:43,897
No way. He is taking this thing
home now. And that's it.

564
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,316
Believe me, Linda, we
did the right thing.

565
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,317
Oh, for sure.

566
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,819
I mean, that was one nasty ghost.

567
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,613
Good thing the exorcism didn't happen.

568
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,865
It would have been mondo tough.

569
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,202
I see a vision.

570
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,163
What is it?

571
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:07,003
Me... Ln your car...
Going home.

572
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:12,050
Just some more psychic humor.

573
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:15,470
Come on, Brandy, let's
hit the musty dusty.

574
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,016
T.T.F.N.

575
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:27,691
"T.T.F.N.?"

576
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,402
Uh, "ta ta for now."

577
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,117
Uh, thanks for letting me bring her.

578
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:42,205
Don't mention it. To anybody.

579
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,529
You did a good job tonight. Thank you.

580
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,870
You ever heard of the
word "Malfeitor" before?

581
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:27,584
Malfeitor? It's Portuguese,
it means someone evil.

582
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,085
Why?

583
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:32,797
Was David Portuguese?

584
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,133
No, I don't think so.

585
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,677
And he's only ten years old?

586
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:38,887
Yeah.

587
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:41,056
Whoa. He must have taken some mega

588
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:43,558
vitamins, 'cause he
was a real toughie.

589
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:48,521
Something's bothering
you. What is it?

590
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:50,982
I see danger ahead.

591
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:56,446
- For Linda?
- For you, if you miss my house.

592
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:03,578
It's coming up on the right.

593
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:06,247
A little more psychic humor, huh?

594
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:18,760
All kidding aside, though,
something is really icky.

595
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,386
Like what?

596
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:24,349
Not sure. Stay by the phone and
I'll call you later on tonight

597
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,185
after I do the Nancy Drew bit.

598
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,813

Police are calling it
the worst traffic

610
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:37,023
accident in the county's history.

611
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,484
An accident of a different
sort claimed the

612
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,277
life of a Fairfield woman
late last night

613
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,613
when she fell to her death from
a second-floor window.

614
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,823
The woman, Sarah
Crawford, claimed to be

615
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,700
a psychic and worked as a professional

616
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,953
medium under the
pseudonym of "Zarabeth."

617
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,288
Police officials will
not divulge whether

618
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,998
the death was suicide or murder, but

619
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,751
a full-scale investigation is
presently underway.

620
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:01,756
Thank you, Stu. Lee'll be back
with weather right after this.

621
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,140
Yeah, who is it?

622
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,143
Jim, it's Brandon. We have to talk.

623
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,192
Alright, I'll buzz you up.

624
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,320
Okay, but meet me
in the upstairs lobby.

625
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,421
- What's up?
- Where's Linda?

626
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,548
She's asleep, man. Why?

627
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:46,384
Come here.

628
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,389
Zarabeth is dead.

629
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:53,057
What?

630
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,818
Someone or something
pushed her out a window.

631
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,562
Jesus Christ.

632
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,605
She suspected something
about David, she was

633
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,733
going to check on it. I
think David killed her.

634
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,569
Wait a minute, man.
The spirit killed her?

635
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,279
Yes, and I think he cut the
phone line too, so I

636
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,281
couldn't warn Linda about
the Ouija, and he

637
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:09,490
probably killed Lloyd.

638
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,326
But that time I think
he was after you.

639
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:13,244
Man, are you listening to yourself?

640
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,039
You're telling me there's
a ten-year-old ghost

641
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,999
flying around Fairfield
killing people.

642
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Look.

643
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:22,378
I know it sounds crazy but
I am sure that I'm right.

644
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:26,549
I mean, assuming that you are,
why would he wait until now?

645
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,218
You contacted him long before Linda.

646
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,473
I've never been alone. I've always had
people with me when I use the Ouija.

647
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:35,266
OK, so you took it home.

648
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,980
No. I checked the box this
morning. No Ouija.

649
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,275
Man, that's impossible,
I boxed it myself.

650
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,402
Well, maybe Linda removed
it when you weren't

651
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,112
looking. She's obsessed with it, Jim!

652
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,032
That means that she's already fallen
into progressive entrapment.

653
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,869
Well, then I just have to find the
damn thing and get rid of it.

654
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,121
It's too late for that.
Linda is so open now,

655
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,040
I don't think David needs it anymore.

656
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:03,086
You told me that that's where
he got his power.

657
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:06,714
It's just a portal. Most
spirits are trapped in their

658
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:09,675
world and can't enter ours
without some kind of

659
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,386
help, like a medium or a Ouija.

660
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:14,806
Or someone that's been opened
by progressive entrapment.

661
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,017
Yes.

662
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:25,274
You're telling me that Linda
is a portal for David.

663
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:28,778
Eventually.

664
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,115
He'll possess her, unless
we can stop him.

665
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,742
That's why I'm going to Big Bear.

666
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,328
What's in Big Bear?

667
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,997
That's where David claims he died.

668
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,500
Now I have to go there and
check out his story.

669
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:46,879
We can't fight unless we know exactly
who he is and how powerful he is.

670
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:51,092
For all I know, he's been lying to me
since the first time I contacted him.

671
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,141
You're really going up there?

672
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:04,397
I have to.

673
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,069
I feel responsible.

674
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:19,579
Wait, you gonna leave now?

675
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,331
Yeah, until I get back, you
keep an eye on Linda.

676
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,458
Brandon.

677
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,503
Listen, man.

678
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,427
Look, I don't know-I don't
know if I buy all this.

679
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:39,807
But good luck.

680
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,226
David, are you here?

681
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,362
David, have you come back?

682
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,416
Jim!

683
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:49,835
Jim, help!

684
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,836
Linda?

685
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,172
Open up. Open the door.

686
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,006
Jim!

687
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,008
Linda, unlock the door!

688
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,565
Jesus.

689
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:24,829
Jim? Linda?
Is everything alright?

690
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:28,499
Hello? Jim? Linda?

691
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,712
Mrs. Moses, call an ambulance.

692
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:34,255
Why, what happened?

693
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:35,423
Linda's hurt.

694
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,179
She's unconscious.

695
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:07,371
Doctor Rogers, 1742.
Doctor Rogers, 1742.

696
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:15,338
Duherst, what do you want from me?

697
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,968
You know, I don't think I've got the
dexterity to be a juggler either.

698
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,602
My, my, that was rude.

699
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:31,687
I got a D in manners.

700
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:36,651
How well did you know Sarah
Crawford, aka Zarabeth?

701
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:41,072
- Why, was she into card tricks?
- I don't know.

702
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,665
But she managed to get her throat slit
before she went through a window.

703
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,370
That's a pretty neat trick
in anybody's book.

704
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,372
What do you think her
throat was slit with?

705
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:52,625
A hatchet?

706
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,712
Whatever it was, her throat
matched the ropes

707
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,798
that were cut on
the construction site.

708
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,467
Have you found your hammer yet?

709
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,472
No. I guess it just vanished.

710
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:11,519
You know, I saw this magician
once. He managed

711
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,271
to make an entire
elephant disappear.

712
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,440
An entire elephant!

713
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,734
That's no mean feat, either.

714
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:24,031
Just a tiny elephant's pretty tough
just to stick up your sleeve.

715
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,911
Of course, I know that
he didn't really

716
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,372
make that elephant
vanish into thin air.

717
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,292
He just managed to hide it someplace.

718
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,173
- Mr. Morar?
- Yes?

719
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,508
I'm Dr. Gelineau.

720
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,760
Is Linda alright?

721
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,930
Your diagnosis was right
on the nose, a mild

722
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:51,183
concussion. That must
have been quite a fall.

723
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:52,977
Yeah.

724
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,355
How's the baby?

725
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,861
Linda missed her appointment
yesterday, so I didn't

726
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:04,655
get a chance to tell her,
but she's not pregnant.

727
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,493
But she's had morning
sickness all week...

728
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,494
Nevertheless.

729
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:12,163
I'm sorry.

730
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,292
Can I see her?

731
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,587
Sure, but she's still unconscious.

732
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:02,546
I'm going with you.

733
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:10,471
What's our first move
when we get there?

734
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:13,766
Big Bear Public Library.

735
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:15,810
Why?

736
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,020
Why not?

737
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:22,024
Well, as long as you've
got a reason.

738
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:29,615
Oh. Hello.

739
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,116
What?

740
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,327
Wait a minute. Let me enlarge it.

741
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,624
Bingo.

742
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:42,545
A gasoline explosion aboard
a small motorboat claimed

743
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:45,130
the life often-year-old David Simpson
early yesterday morning.

744
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:49,677
Funeral services for David, the only
child of John and Betty Simpson,

745
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:52,346
will be held this Saturday at the
Green Meadows Cemetery.

746
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,226
Well, now we know David's
telling the truth.

747
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:00,104
We still don't know why
he's terrorizing Linda.

748
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,524
How do we find that out?

749
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,154
We ask his parents.

750
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:20,165
Damn it! There's not one listing
for John or Betty Simpson.

751
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:27,840
Did the article say David was buried
at the Green Meadows Cemetery?

752
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:29,425
Yeah. So?

753
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,178
So maybe the caretaker's got
their address on an invoice.

754
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,615
Jesus, don't do that to me, alright?

755
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,366
Sorry, man.

756
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:58,412
Look, nobody's home.
Place is locked up.

757
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:00,623
Oh, damn it.

758
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:03,292
I guess we're just gonna have
to come back tomorrow.

759
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:08,130
Well, as long as we're here, I'm
gonna check out David's grave.

760
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,090
Why?

761
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:12,760
Why not?

762
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:14,428
No, Jim, don't!

763
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,608
I've got a very bad
feeling about this.

764
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:39,536
Oh, god, I've got a bad
feeling about this.

765
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:55,886
Jim?

766
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:00,849
Jim?

767
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:02,643
Where are you?

768
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,614
Whoa!

769
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,491
Shit.

770
01:08:41,493 --> 01:08:42,618
Oh, god.

771
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,161
You scared the shit out of me.

772
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,081
Shut up, just shut up.
You're gonna get

773
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:49,333
us both arrested for grave robbery.

774
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,293
Where were you?

775
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,253
I found someone I want you to meet.

776
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:55,255
Who?

777
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:57,925
David's parents.

778
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,513
Look at the date, man.

779
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:06,433
David's parents died on the same day.

780
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,393
Less than two weeks ago.

781
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,771
Must have been some
kind of an accident.

782
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,192
What if it wasn't?

783
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,616
I'm going to
try and get some sleep.

784
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,656
Gotta get out to the dock
first thing in the morning.

785
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,998
I don't suppose you have an
extra toothbrush in that bag.

786
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,377
I'm afraid not.

787
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:37,297
Damn, I hate talking to ghosts
with plaque on my teeth.

788
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:45,180
A little psychic humor.

789
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,060
God, why are we laughing?

790
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:53,522
It helps us forget how scared we are.

791
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:02,865
What happened to us, man?

792
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,162
We used to be like brothers.

793
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:14,501
I don't know. Things change.

794
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:16,295
People change.

795
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,883
I didn't steal her from
you. You know that.

796
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,553
I know.

797
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:28,182
It's just that every time I see the
two of you together, I go crazy.

798
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:32,519
I start saying stupid
things and I can't stop.

799
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,857
I tell myself, "Brandon, stop
being such an asshole."

800
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:39,818
Then my mouth pops open and
out comes another stupid quip.

801
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,363
You're still in love with her.

802
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:54,374
I envy you that.

803
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,544
You remember what you said
about me quitting med school?

804
01:10:58,379 --> 01:10:59,963
Jim, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

805
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:02,007
No, no, you were right.

806
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:07,095
You know what I'm afraid of
more than anything else?

807
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,350
That I'll never be able
to love anyone.

808
01:11:12,644 --> 01:11:15,771
And that I'm gonna end up spending
the rest of my life alone.

809
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,532
If I had any real guts
I'd get out of her life

810
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,409
before she wastes any more time on me.

811
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:38,752
So tell me.

812
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,383
What does she see in you
that she didn't see in me?

813
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:47,052
I make her laugh.

814
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,054
So did I.

815
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:52,474
Yeah. But only in the bedroom.

816
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,870
You really are an asshole,
you know that?

817
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:15,998
Yeah.

818
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:25,424
Linda.

819
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:17,309
Linda. Come here.

820
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,500
- What'd you get?
- Take it.

821
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:42,876
Let's go.

822
01:13:47,382 --> 01:13:48,548
Oh, man.

823
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:52,386
- Haven't we seen enough of these?
- We're gonna need it to contact David.

824
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,139
Man, I got a real bad
feeling about this.

825
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:03,984
What are you doing, man? I thought
we had to put this thing on our knees.

826
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:05,482
Not this time.

827
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:08,318
Since this is where
David died, contact

828
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:10,195
with the spirit should be very strong.

829
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:12,114
Not too strong, I hope.

830
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:15,409
Don't worry. If I'm right
about Linda being his

831
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:17,494
portal, she's too far away
for him to reach us.

832
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,163
What if you're wrong and
the Ouija's the portal?

833
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:22,374
We're gonna be opening the
door if we use this thing.

834
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,000
I'm not wrong.

835
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:27,504
Linda is his portal. David can't hurt
us here, we're too far away.

836
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,173
Besides, he can't do anything
while she's sleeping.

837
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:32,134
She's under sedation, right?

838
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:34,386
Yeah.

839
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:37,931
Linda?

840
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,143
I think you should stay and let
us run some more tests.

841
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:44,396
Oh, no, I feel fine. I just
want to go home now.

842
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:46,606
Thanks.

843
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:53,572
David, why are you terrorizing Linda?

844
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:03,707
"N-O?" N-O-what?

845
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:09,212
"T."

846
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:10,922
"N-O-T." Not?

847
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,508
David, do you mean you're
not terrorizing Linda?

848
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:18,138
Then who is?

849
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:34,321
Evil. What the hell
does that mean?

850
01:15:35,907 --> 01:15:37,032
I don't know.

851
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:40,118
Wait a minute.

852
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:45,999
David. You were at Jim's
party, weren't you?

853
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:50,712
And you flattened my tire?

854
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:59,387
David, now, this is very important.
Please tell us the truth.

855
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:04,309
Did you kill Lloyd at
the construction site?

856
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:10,690
And you didn't kill Zarabeth?

857
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,319
But you did speak to
us through her.

858
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,157
No.

859
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:21,826
Then who the hell did we talk to?

860
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,218
Again with the evil.

861
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,349
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I think I have it.

862
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,180
David.

863
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,600
Is this evil another spirit?

864
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:53,275
Is this spirit powerful? Did it force
you out of Jim's apartment?

865
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,572
Is this spirit's name Malfeitor?

866
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,369
Then Linda never actually
contacted you

867
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,496
all the time she was using my Ouija.

868
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:12,294
Alright, then who's Malfeitor?

869
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:14,170
That's what we're gonna find out.

870
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:19,759
David? Who is Malfeitor?

871
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:35,984
"Her?" Who is "her?"

872
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,777
David, do you mean Linda?

873
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,947
Well, then who is "her?"

874
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:46,369
What's wrong?

875
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,580
I don't know, he's agitated.
Be careful.

876
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:52,375
David, are you alright?
What's the matter?

877
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:54,919
Hey.

878
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:57,756
Didn't you say they
were lousy spellers?

879
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,843
David, did you misspell the word?

880
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:08,892
Alright. Okay.

881
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:13,688
Just try again.

882
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,066
One more time, slowly.

883
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,069
Who is Malfeitor?

884
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:25,075
H.

885
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:29,954
E.

886
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:34,292
R.

887
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:42,509
What happened?

888
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:44,344
I lost him.

889
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,971
It happens sometimes. David.

890
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:51,017
- Can't you get him back?
- I don't know! David!

891
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:54,813
- What is he trying to spell here?
- I don't know! David?

892
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:59,317
H-E-R-E. Here!

893
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,737
Malfeitor is here.

894
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:04,889
But he can't be, that would mean...

895
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:41,901
Jim.

896
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,096
Brandon?

897
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:03,691
Brandon!

898
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,574
Oh! Jesus!

899
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:01,207
Oh, god.

900
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:08,131
Oh. Oh, god.

901
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:11,301
Oh, god.

902
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:14,132
David?

903
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:21,055
David, where are you?

904
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,226
David, what have you done with Jim?

905
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,604
David, answer me, goddammit.

906
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,798
Bastard.

907
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:12,815
Carlos Malfeitor was
a fairly notorious

908
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:14,525
mass murderer in his day.

909
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:19,238
He killed nine people. Chopped
them all up with an axe.

910
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:23,159
Whatever happened to him?
Is he still alive?

911
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,621
No, the police finally caught
up to him around 1930.

912
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:29,165
Shot him down in his own home.

913
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:33,836
There it is.

914
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:43,679
Hello?

915
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:46,015
Yes, I'd like to speak
to Linda Brewster.

916
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:48,726
She's a patient in room 310.

917
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:51,437
No! No. 375.

918
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:54,232
It's an emergency!

919
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,569
What? When?

920
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:00,066
Linda?

921
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:11,786
Jesus Christ.

922
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:29,637
Linda, I'm trying to help you.

923
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:33,140
Fine. Then stop moving.

924
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:31,532
Go ahead, James.

925
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,076
What are you waiting for?

926
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:35,369
Linda...

927
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:36,787
I love you.

928
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:43,669
Jim?

929
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:48,132
God, Linda, I...

930
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,761
It's not that easy, James.

931
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:08,444
Don't move, asshole!

932
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,697
The rest of you people go back
down to your apartments, now!

933
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:18,968
I understand you left quite a mess
up there in Big Bear, Mr. Morar.

934
01:30:20,207 --> 01:30:21,707
Duherst, listen.

935
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,168
It's not what you think.

936
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,546
Listen to me. Don't...

937
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,385
Mrs. Brewster, can you stand?

938
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,317
You won't kill her, James.

939
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:50,069
I'll just shoot her in the leg.

940
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:54,240
That won't change anything.

941
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:57,660
It'll buy us some time.

942
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:02,456
Time to fight you. Time for
Linda to close the portal.

943
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:06,669
Only you can do that, James.

944
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,170
Put it down.

945
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,173
Put it down!

946
01:31:18,432 --> 01:31:21,475
You're so... smart.

947
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,607
You haven't figured it out
yet, have you, James?

948
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:33,863
You're the portal.

949
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:35,698
Not Linda.

950
01:31:37,868 --> 01:31:39,243
You're the one I opened.

951
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:42,663
You're the one I terrorized
by torturing

952
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,832
Linda and killing your friends.

953
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:51,380
And it's mine as long as you live.

954
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:53,466
Bullshit.

955
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:56,427
Bullshit, you tried to kill me.

956
01:31:57,387 --> 01:32:01,682
No. Just to scare you.

957
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:04,810
You're the portal, James.

958
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:12,109
Want to save Linda? That's right.

959
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:16,363
You've got the means right there in
your hands. Go ahead, James.

960
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:20,826
Close the portal.

961
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:23,996
But you won't.

962
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:29,710
You can't.

963
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:36,884
You don't love her that much.
Not that much.

964
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:42,598
Linda.

965
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,184
Is she worth it, James?

966
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:52,274
Is anybody really worth it?
Think about it.

967
01:32:58,740 --> 01:32:59,740
Jim, don't!

968
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,092
I now pronounce you man and wife.

969
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:02,303
You may kiss the bride.

970
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,161
Look what I found.

971
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:36,503
A Ouija board. Gee, I haven't seen
one of these since I was a kid.

972
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,505
I didn't know they've
been around that long.

973
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:42,885
I wonder if it still works.

974
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:46,180
With all those holes in it?
